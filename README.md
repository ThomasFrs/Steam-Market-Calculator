# Steam Calculator
It is a small program with a simple GUI made for calculations in the Steam Market.\
However, it is quite messy since it is my first real program made with Tkinter.\
I have simplified three of the most common calculations made on the Steam Market.

## How To Use
- Enter any value and press "Calculate" to get the output.\
- Clear the query fields with "C".

## Item Value Converter
It is used to convert each of the Steam Market's main currencies (USD, Keys, Refs, Scraps) into each other.\
Ex: 5 USD and 24 Refs = 5.72 USD or 3.23 Keys or 190.67 Refs or 1733 Scraps.

## Total Price to Taxfree Price
It is used to calculate the price of an item without added Steam taxes (+15%).\
In other words, it allows you to determine the real price of an item (without taxes) that you see on the Steam Market\
and therefore, to know how much you are gonna get when selling an item without buying it beforehand.\
Ex: You see a Key that costs 2 USD, if you resell it at this price, you will gain 1.73 USD and will lose 0.27 USD in the process.

## Taxfree Price to Total Price
It is used to calculate the price of an item with added Steam taxes (+15%).\
It is less useful than the previous function but it can be used to determine at which price\
you will have to sell an item to start to make a profit.\
Ex: You have bought a Key for 2 USD, you will have to sell the Key for 2.30 USD in order to start making profit.
